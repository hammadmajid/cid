# Competitive Intelligence Dashboard

The project aims to build an automated framework using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve Competitive Intelligence (CI) for businesses. The goal is to replace manual, error-prone data collection with an intelligent system that turns unstructured text into strategic insights.

## The Problem It Solves

Data Overload: Companies are drowning in digital text—customer reviews, social media, competitor announcements, and news—and cannot process it manually.

- Inefficiency: Current methods are too slow and miss critical market signals or customer sentiments.
- Lack of Integration: Existing tools usually do just one thing (like sentiment analysis) rather than combining multiple techniques for a full picture.

## The Proposed Solution

The project proposes a unified system that scrapes data from the web (news, reviews, competitor sites) and processes it to answer strategic questions.

It relies on three specific technical pillars:

- Sentiment Analysis: Detecting emotional tone (e.g., are customers angry at a competitor's new product?).
- Topic Modeling (LDA): Finding hidden themes in thousands of documents (e.g., what specific features are people discussing?).
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Automatically extracting specific brand names, products, and locations to track competitor moves.

## End Goal

To create a dashboard or tool that gives decision-makers real-time, accurate data on market dynamics and competitor activities without requiring them to read thousands of documents.
